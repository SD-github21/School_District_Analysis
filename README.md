# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis
The initial purpose of the school district analysis was to assist in providing important summary data about the performance of schools within a school district based upon results of standardized testing scores, i.e., math and reading scores. This analysis was completed and included several important key deliverables:
- School District Summary
- Individual School Summary
- Summary of the top 5 highest performing schools & the bottom 5 lowest performing schools
- Summary of average math scores and average reading scores for each grade level from each school
- Summary of scores by school spending per student
- Summary of scores by school size
- Summary of scores by school type

Due to the discovery of evidence pointing to academic dishonesty within the 9th grade class of Thomas High School, a new analysis plan was formulated to assist the school board by (1) replacing Thomas High School's 9th grade math and scores with "NaNs" (signifying a lack of data) and (2) repeating the above school district analysis to provide an updated version of the same key deliverables. 

## Resources
- Data Sources: schools_complete.csv & students_complete.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.10, Anaconda 1.7.2, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy

## Results 
The following results depict how each of the above seven school district metrics were affected by the changes that were conducted to account for removal of Thomas High School's 9th grade math and reading scores.
